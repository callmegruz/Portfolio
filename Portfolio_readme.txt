Hybrid Movie Recommendation System
Project Overview
This project is a hybrid movie recommendation system developed using the MovieLens 1M dataset. The system combines both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized and accurate movie recommendations. A user-friendly interface has been developed to enhance the interaction with the system.

Key Features:
Hybrid Recommendation Model: Combines content-based filtering (movie features) and collaborative filtering (user preferences) to generate precise movie recommendations.
Personalized Suggestions: The model delivers movie suggestions tailored to the user's viewing history and preferences.
User Interface: The project comes with a designed interface for better user interaction, hosted via an external UI platform, though users can use their own hosting solution.
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
2. Install Dependencies
Move into the project folder and install the required dependencies. These can be installed using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
cd repository-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Prepare and Train the Model
You’ll first need to train the collaborative filtering model. The collaborative filtering model allows personalized movie suggestions based on user interactions with the dataset.

Open the relevant Jupyter notebook or Python script that handles the model training:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook collaborative_model.ipynb
After training the model, save it locally for future use so that you don't have to retrain it each time. Use the following code to save the trained model:

python
Copy code
model.save('collaborative_model.h5')
Make sure the saved model is placed in the correct directory so that it can be loaded by the application when running.

4. Run the Application Interface
The project also includes a user interface where users can interact with the movie recommendation system. The UI is hosted externally, but you can use your own hosting platform if preferred.

To run the application locally:

Make sure the pre-trained collaborative model is stored in the correct location.
Run the project_app.ipynb or the appropriate Python script that starts the UI:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook project_app.ipynb
If using the external UI host, you can follow the instructions in the file to interact with the system directly through the provided host.
If you prefer to host the interface locally, you can modify the necessary configurations to point to your own server or hosting platform.
5. Load the Pre-Trained Model
When running the app, the saved collaborative model will be loaded to provide movie recommendations. Ensure that the correct path to the saved model (collaborative_model.h5) is specified in the project_app.ipynb or relevant files.

6. Customize the Model and UI
Model Customization: You can retrain the model with different configurations or datasets by adjusting parameters in collaborative_model.ipynb.
UI Customization: Developers can use their own UI host by modifying the project_app.ipynb to point to their local or external host of choice.
7. Future Enhancements
You can further enhance the system by:

Integrating new recommendation techniques (e.g., neural collaborative filtering).
Improving the user interface for better user experience.

Here's a clear and concise structure for your portfolio website project README:

Portfolio Website Template
Project Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a clean, modern, and fully responsive template that users can customize to showcase their personal projects, skills, and experiences. The template is designed to be easily modifiable, allowing developers to adapt it for their own portfolios with minimal effort.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on all devices, from desktop to mobile.
Customizable: Easily edit content, colors, and sections to suit your personal style and portfolio needs.
Modern Layout: Includes sections for skills, projects, about, and contact information.
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and customize your portfolio website:

1. Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-website.git
2. Open the Project
After cloning, navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd portfolio-website
3. Customize the Content
The website template is structured into different sections (e.g., About Me, Projects, Skills, Contact). Here's how you can edit the content:

index.html: Open this file in your preferred text or HTML editor. Here you can change the text for each section, such as:
About Me: Add your name, a brief bio, and an image.
Projects: List your key projects with descriptions and links to their repositories.
Skills: Mention your technical skills (e.g., programming languages, frameworks).
Contact: Edit your email address and social media links.
4. Customize the Styles
The styling is controlled by the style.css file:

To customize the colors, fonts, and layout, open the style.css file located in the css/ directory.

You can adjust the primary colors to suit your personal brand or aesthetic.

For example, to change the background color:

css
Copy code
body {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
5. Add JavaScript Interactions
The script.js file (located in the js/ folder) handles the interactive elements of your website. If you want to add more dynamic features like scroll animations or form validation, you can modify or extend this file.

6. Preview the Website
Once you have customized the content, open the index.html file in any web browser to view your portfolio locally. Simply double-click the index.html file or use:

bash
Copy code
open index.html
7. Deploy the Website
Once you're satisfied with the changes, you can deploy your website online. Here are a few popular options for hosting static websites:

GitHub Pages: You can deploy your portfolio directly from this GitHub repository using GitHub Pages:

Push the repository to GitHub.
Go to Settings > Pages in your repository.
Set the source to the main branch.
Your website will be live at https://yourusername.github.io/portfolio-website/.

Netlify or Vercel: You can also use services like Netlify or Vercel for easy deployment with continuous integration.
